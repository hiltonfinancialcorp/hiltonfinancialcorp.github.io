### Subsection title {-}


# CHAPTER TEMPLATE {-}

Putting the `{-}` after the section name makes it so the chapter will not be automatically numbered.


##  SUBSECTION TITLE

The more `###` you add, the farther down you go into subsections. 
See how this one got a number, because we didn't add the `{-}`?

## Addng pictures {- #picturetemplate}

The following code will insert a picture.



```{r example-macarons, fig.cap='A pretty picture of tasty food', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('images/macarons.jpg'))
```

The phrase after the first `r` must be hypenated if it's more than one word (spaces will confuse it), 
it's a reference you can use later if you want to point the reader to this specific image.

`fig.cap` allows you to add a caption.

`echo = FALSE` makes it so the code that inserts the picture does not show up in the final product (switch it to `TRUE` or leave it out to see what happens).

the `knitr`... section contains a path to the image. 
It's probably easiest to upload all the images in the `images` folder, 
and give them all short and easy names.

(If you're looking at the source code, notice that we added `#picturetemplate` after the `{-` part of the section title. 
This allows us to reference this section elsewhere in the book, with a clickable link, if wanted.
If we end up changing the order of things, it will automatically detect that and correct the link and numbering for it,
so it's better than using a page number or something like that.)
