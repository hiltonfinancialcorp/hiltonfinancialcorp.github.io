# A Message from the Author


Lending money to others is one of the oldest businesses in the world. You read about it in the Bible and many other ancient books. In this book, we’ll discuss a wide array of investments associated with moneylending and banking. We’ll briefly discuss the history of banking. We’ll talk about the types of banks  extant today. We’ll talk about starting your own bank, whether that will be a large mortgage banking operation, or a small, self-directed lending business. I’ll give you an overview of the common concerns bankers and private lenders deal with daily. We’ll review common ways to protect your investments and how the current laws either enable or limit your investments.

This publication is designed to provide general information about the subject matter covered. Bearing in mind that laws and practices vary from city to city, state to state, and country to country, and also because each individual situation will be different, the reader should consult with appropriate advisors regarding any specific situation. 

The author has taken reasonable precautions in the preparation of this book and believes the material is accurate as of the date it was written. However, neither the author nor the publisher assume any responsibility for any error or omission. Nor can we warrant accuracy against the progress of time. Legislation and industry practices may further change the face of lending with each day that passes. The author and publisher specifically disclaim any liability resulting from the use or application of the information contained in this book. The information in this book is not intended to serve as legal or professional advice related to any individual situation.

With the above legal disclaimer out of the way, we’re free to jump into the fascinating world of moneylending. But first, I’ll tell you about how I got my start in banking and some of the important milestones and anecdotes from my career.
