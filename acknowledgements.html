<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>For this book the following references works were used:
The Chicago Manual of Style (CMS; 17th edition),
Words Into Type (3rd edition),
and Merriam-Websterâ€™s Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition, online).</p>
<p>This book has been in the making for several years.
I wish to thank all of those who have helped in anyway in editing, comments, and contributions to the text of this book.</p>
<p>Stephen Haggard reviewed an early manuscript of this work and made several valuable comments.
Steve was with me when I was a director and chairman of Rocky Mountain Bank.
We were grooming him to be the next president.
Banks always need a succession plan, and Steve was ours.
He is now the president, CEO, and director of Metro Phoenix Bank.
A more dedicated, hardworking, and honest person is hard to find in the banking world.
I am glad to have been working with Steve for so many years and serving with him as a director and at Metro Phoenix Bank.</p>
<p>My family has been very helpful in many ways.
My children grew up in the real estate and lending world
and many of them have contributed to reading and editing past versions of the manuscript.</p>
<p>My son Nicholas Hilton was with Hilton Financial Corporation for many years.
At the beginning of the Great Recession,
he decided he wanted to move to a cooler climate,
so off to Denver he and his family went.
He is currently an underwriter for a mortgage company and also holds a real estate license in Arizona.
Nick helped with organizing and editing the early manuscripts of this work, for which I am grateful.</p>
<p>My son, Jack Hilton II, has helped compile and edit this book,
bringing it from the early manuscripts to a finished product.
Jack added a lot of content to this book from his personal knowledge and research.
Jack is a loan officer at Hilton Financial Corporation
and has been with the company for many years.
He knows the business inside and out,
and I am very grateful for the dedication he has shown on this project.</p>
<p>My son Beau Hilton and daughter, Charli Hilton Hayes,
have both reviewed and made comments on earlier manuscripts.
Beau is a doctor, currently serving his residency and internship at Vanderbilt,
and Charli is currently working at Metro Phoenix Bank.
Both are high performers in their fields.</p>
<p>My wife, Marci, has been an inspiration to this work from the beginning.
When we were first married, I had to learn to not talk real estate and finance in every conversation.
There are a lot more romantic conversations to be spoken than talking shop. M
arci can hold her own with any conversation in the subject of real estate or finance,
and it is fun to watch and listen.
We have five wonderful children.
We had three children and then an eight-year gap, and then two more.
Marci likes to tell people she was a single mom with the first three children.
It took me that long to figure things out and get my head above the water of learning,
even though we are never really done learning.
Heaven forbid.</p>
