# Notes on usage

- careful of unicode characters
- if you add a new chapter, go to the `_bookdown.yml` file and add it to the list where you want it to go:

```
rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "01-appetizers_beverages.Rmd", "02-literature.Rmd", "03-method.Rmd", "04-application.Rmd", "05-summary.Rmd"]
```
