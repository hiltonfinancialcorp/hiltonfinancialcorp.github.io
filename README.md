## Be careful of unicode characters
Text on the web, or in a word processing program like Word, often looks simple enough, but is actually composed of a large number of codes specifying *exactly which* version of that character the computer is supposed to process and show you. 

There's a whole story [here](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), if you're interested. 

A classic example of a problematic character is the quotation mark. If you try to paste in a snippet of text from Word or the internet that contains a quotation mark, there's a good chance it will be one of a number of close relatives of the simple quotation mark, some of which will choke the software that converts the text for our book into a PDF. To avoid this problem, either type it out yourself, or paste it into something that will convert the character for you (on Windows, NotePad is great, or if you want an online option, use something like [this converter](https://onlineasciitools.com/convert-unicode-to-ascii)).
