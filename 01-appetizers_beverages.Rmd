## What’s the Difference Between Chop, Dice, and Mince? {#notes}

### I don't know but try these comments {-}
Sometimes the words chop and dice are used interchangeably, but technically the word dice is used for smaller pieces and the word chop is used for larger pieces.
You seldom see the term large dice, but you will see large chop and small dice rather frequently. Dice can also refer to cutting vegetable into cubes of a specific size while chop is less precise. In general, chop is more casual and has more leeway while dice is more specific.
The word mince means a very small dice.

### How Big is a Dice? How Small is a Mince? {-}
How do you know how big or small something is supposed to be? If the recipe writer feels it matters, 
usually they will also include a measurement, like 3/4″ dice. 
Again, we see the word dice here to indicate that this is a very specific direction. 
But if the sizing has some leeway, they will say either large, medium or small chop. Unfortunately, 
these sizes aren’t standardized so it’s hard to give measurements.

- Large chop – For me, when a recipe says large chop, I usually make it roughly the size of a nickel.
- 
- Medium Chop – Medium chop is about half the size of a nickel.
- 
- Diced (Small Chop) – Small chop is about half of medium chop, perhaps a quarter inch to a side.
- 
- Minced – Mince is very fine, as small as I can get it.
