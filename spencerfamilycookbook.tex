Heat just to a bubbling boil, cover and reduce heat to low (2-3) on my stove.
Let cook for about 3 hours stirring occasionally. If you are doing meatballs\ldots{} you may cook them right
in the sauce for the last 45 minutes or so of the 3 hours cooking time. For meatballs I combine pork
sausage with ground beef and salt and pepper about 1-1 1/2 lbs. all together. Form into smaller meatballs
and drop directly into the sauce. 1-2 inch meatballs seem to absorb the flavor better, but do not over cook
them or they are not as tender. Italian sausage is also great in the sauce too. This, I slice and cook
in a separate pan before adding to the sauce.

Mix together the flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, salt, and egg replacer ( if used ). Set aside. Add 1 teaspoon or the sugar to the water and stir in the yeast. Set aside. Grease 6 English muffin rings and place them on a greased baking sheet. I use small Corning ware dishes for these. In a mixing bowl, blend together, using a mixer at low speed, the remaining sugar, egg, margarine, dough enhancer, and yeast water. Beat in half the flour mixture. With a spoon, stir in the remaining flour and beat until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared rings or dishes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until the batter doubles, 40 -- 45 minutes for regular yeast; 20 -- 25 minutes for rapid rise. Preheat oven to 375Â°. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until browned lightly and pulled slightly away from the rings. Makes 6 crumpets.

Add the sugar, syrup, butter, baking powder, and salt. Beat well. Drop the batter onto a medium-hot Teflon or lightly greased griddle by the tablespoon to make scones 2 Â½ inches in diameter. Cook as for pancakes, but since these are thicker, they will need to be on the heat longer, since these are thicker, they will need to be on the heat longer, so don't have the griddle extra hot, or you will have doughy centers. Serve hot. Split to fill with butter and jam, sausage, or cheese. Makes 5 or 6 scones. I use this recipe to make Dad's pancakes. I use about double the amount of milk to thin it enough for pancakes.

I have also used a 9x13 pan as Dad likes this better than a Bundt pam. I made this cake for Lori and Beau's wedding to take on their honeymoon. They really liked it.

\item
  On low speed, slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be slightly sticky. Cover dough tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour and up to 2-3 days.
\item
  Preheat oven to Â°. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies). Set aside.
\item
  Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. If the cookie dough chilled longer than 2 hours, let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. The cookies may not spread in the oven if the dough it that cold. Roll cookie dough, 1 tablespoon each, into balls. Roll each in granulated sugar and arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until edges appear set. If the tops aren't appearing cracked, remove the baking sheet from the oven and gently bang it on the counter 2-3 times. This will help those warm cookies spread out and crack on top. Return to the oven for 1 additional minute.
\item
  Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
\item
  Cookies will say fresh covered at room temperature for 1 week.

Wash fruit and ``score'' (peel into quarters). Remove sections of peels and cut into uniform strips, about 3/8 `` wide to make about 3 cups of peels. In large saucepan, bring peels and 6 cups water to a boil; boil for 10 minutes. Drain, rinse peels and repeat process with 6 cups fresh water. In large saucepan, bring 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup honey and 1 3/4 cups water to a boil for 1 minute. Add drained peels and simmer 40-45 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Drain peels well for about 10 minutes. Place remaining sugar in a small bowl. Toss drained peels with sugar until well coated. Spread peels on wax paper to dry. Peels must be very dry for chocolate to adhere. In the top of a double boiler or in microwave, melt chocolate, stirring occasionally. Dip two-thirds of each peel strip into melted chocolate and place on waxed paper. After chocolate has set, store dipped peels in an airtight container in cool, dry, place. Makes 60 to 80 candied peels.

Let butter melt in a heavy kettle. (You can substitute butter for margarine. I have always used butter.)Then add Karo syrup, water, and sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved on medium hear. When it starts to boil, stir occasionally while you do the following: Select a cookie sheet with sides. Butter the sheet, then spread chocolate chips evenly in the pan. Cover with nuts. Stir candy from bottom of pan frequently. When it begins to turn tan, put in dandy thermometer. You have to stir more often or it will burn. When mixture reaches 280Â°, pour thinly and evenly over chips and nuts. This has to be done quickly or you will not be able to spread the candy evenly across the pan. Cover all areas (a measuring cup with a pour edge works well or best to pour directly from the saucepan. Some minor spreading can be done to even out. As soon as candy is poured and spread, to it with chunks of the chocolate bar which will melt and then can be spread across the entire surface. When slightly cool, sprinkle 1 cup of finely chopped walnuts on the surface. Let cool. Set preferably overnight, then break in chunks and store in quart jars. This is better when aged 2 to 3 days. It will keep for a good amount of time. This candy has become a family tradition at Christmas time. I usually make three or more batches depending on how much I plan to give as gifts.

In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in the flour, baking powder and salt. Cover, and chill dough for at least one hour (or overnightr). Preheat oven to 400Â°. Roll out dough on floured surface 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick. Cut into shapes with any cookie cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 6 to 8 minutes in preheated oven. Cool completely. TIP: Roll cookie dough out on parchment paper and cut out shapes with cookie cutter. Remove dough around cut outs and transfer parchment paper ont cookie sheet. This way you don't ruin the cookies by peeling them off the counter and you can reuse the parchment paper for your next batch.

Excellent with pork roast, spareribs, and chicken. With pork roast and spareribs, brown the meat in 350Â° oven until well browned, then cover with sauce, baste occasionally. Cook for at least one hour. For chicken just arrange chicken pieces in baking dish. Pour thick sauce over, it will thin as chicken cooks. Bake at 350Â° until done, about 1 1/2 hours. Suggest lining pan with foil as this is a good pan sticker. It is also yummy!

\subsection*{I don't know but try these comments}\label{i-dont-know-but-try-these-comments}}


Sometimes the words chop and dice are used interchangeably, but technically the word dice is used for smaller pieces and the word chop is used for larger pieces. You seldom see the term large dice, but you will see large chop and small dice rather frequently. Dice can also refer to cutting vegetable into cubes of a specific size while chop is less precise. In general, chop is more casual and has more leeway while dice is more specific. The word mince means a very small dice.

\subsection*{How Big is a Dice? How Small is a Mince?}\label{how-big-is-a-dice-how-small-is-a-mince}}


How do you know how big or small something is supposed to be? If the recipe writer feels it matters, usually they will also include a measurement, like 3/4" dice. Again, we see the word dice here to indicate that this is a very specific direction. But if the sizing has some leeway, they will say either large, medium or small chop. Unfortunately, these sizes aren't standardized so it's hard to give measurements.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Large chop -- For me, when a recipe says large chop, I usually make it roughly the size of a nickel.
\item
\item
  Medium Chop -- Medium chop is about half the size of a nickel.
\item
\item
  Diced (Small Chop) -- Small chop is about half of medium chop, perhaps a quarter inch to a side.
\item
\item
  Minced -- Mince is very fine, as small as I can get it.
