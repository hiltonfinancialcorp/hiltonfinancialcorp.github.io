\subsection*{I don't know but try these comments}\label{i-dont-know-but-try-these-comments}}


Sometimes the words chop and dice are used interchangeably, but technically the word dice is used for smaller
pieces and the word chop is used for larger pieces.
You seldom see the term large dice, but you will see large chop and small dice rather frequently.
Dice can also refer to cutting vegetable into cubes of a specific size while chop is less precise.
In general, chop is more casual and has more leeway while dice is more specific.
The word mince means a very small dice.

\hypertarget{how-big-is-a-dice-how-small-is-a-mince}{%
\subsection*{How Big is a Dice? How Small is a Mince?}\label{how-big-is-a-dice-how-small-is-a-mince}}


How do you know how big or small something is supposed to be? If the recipe writer feels it matters,
usually they will also include a measurement, like 3/4" dice.
Again, we see the word dice here to indicate that this is a very specific direction.
But if the sizing has some leeway, they will say either large, medium or small chop. Unfortunately,
these sizes aren't standardized so it's hard to give measurements.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Large chop -- For me, when a recipe says large chop, I usually make it roughly the size of a nickel.
\item
\item
  Medium Chop -- Medium chop is about half the size of a nickel.
\item
\item
  Diced (Small Chop) -- Small chop is about half of medium chop, perhaps a quarter inch to a side.
\item
\item
  Minced -- Mince is very fine, as small as I can get it.
\end{itemize}

Wash and chop the vegetables into 1/2 to 3/4 inch pieces for even cooking.
Do not peel the vegetables. Be sure to dry the mushrooms well after washing.
Wet mushrooms turn mushy when cooked. Place the dice vegetables in a large mixing bowl.
Cover lightly with extra-virgin olive oil. Mix well to make sure all the pieces are covered in
light oil, but avoid drenching. Too much oil leads to soggy vegetables. Season with salt, pepper,
chopped parsley and diced garlic. Place a flat backing pan in a 500 degree oven.
Allow the pan to roast in the oven until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour vegetables from the bowl onto
the sizzling hot pan. The hot pan helps sear in the vegetables natural moisture. Bake at 500 degrees
for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through. The vegetables are done when the vegetables begin to turn grown on the edges.
Ratatouille can be served hot as a vegetable entrée over rice or tossed with
tomato sauce and served over pasta. It also can be served cold or at room temperature with bread or crackers.

Heat just to a bubbling boil, cover and reduce heat to low (2-3) on my stove.
Let cook for about 3 hours stirring occasionally. If you are doing meatballs\ldots{} you may cook them right
in the sauce for the last 45 minutes or so of the 3 hours cooking time. For meatballs I combine pork
sausage with ground beef and salt and pepper about 1-1 1/2 lbs. all together. Form into smaller meatballs
and drop directly into the sauce. 1-2 inch meatballs seem to absorb the flavor better, but do not over cook
them or they are not as tender. Italian sausage is also great in the sauce too. This, I slice and cook
in a separate pan before adding to the sauce.

Mix together the flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, salt, and egg replacer ( if used ). Set aside. Add 1 teaspoon or the sugar to the water and stir in the yeast. Set aside. Grease 6 English muffin rings and place them on a greased baking sheet. I use small Corning ware dishes for these. In a mixing bowl, blend together, using a mixer at low speed, the remaining sugar, egg, margarine, dough enhancer, and yeast water. Beat in half the flour mixture. With a spoon, stir in the remaining flour and beat until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared rings or dishes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until the batter doubles, 40 -- 45 minutes for regular yeast; 20 -- 25 minutes for rapid rise. Preheat oven to 375°. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until browned lightly and pulled slightly away from the rings. Makes 6 crumpets.

Add the sugar, syrup, butter, baking powder, and salt. Beat well. Drop the batter onto a medium-hot Teflon or lightly greased griddle by the tablespoon to make scones 2 ½ inches in diameter. Cook as for pancakes, but since these are thicker, they will need to be on the heat longer, since these are thicker, they will need to be on the heat longer, so don't have the griddle extra hot, or you will have doughy centers. Serve hot. Split to fill with butter and jam, sausage, or cheese. Makes 5 or 6 scones. I use this recipe to make Dad's pancakes. I use about double the amount of milk to thin it enough for pancakes.

Wash fruit and ``score'' (peel into quarters). Remove sections of peels and cut into uniform strips, about 3/8 `` wide to make about 3 cups of peels. In large saucepan, bring peels and 6 cups water to a boil; boil for 10 minutes. Drain, rinse peels and repeat process with 6 cups fresh water. In large saucepan, bring 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup honey and 1 3/4 cups water to a boil for 1 minute. Add drained peels and simmer 40-45 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Drain peels well for about 10 minutes. Place remaining sugar in a small bowl. Toss drained peels with sugar until well coated. Spread peels on wax paper to dry. Peels must be very dry for chocolate to adhere. In the top of a double boiler or in microwave, melt chocolate, stirring occasionally. Dip two-thirds of each peel strip into melted chocolate and place on waxed paper. After chocolate has set, store dipped peels in an airtight container in cool, dry, place. Makes 60 to 80 candied peels.

Preheat the oven to 250°. Combine the brown sugar, corn syrup, butter and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring enough to blend. Once the mixture begins to boil, foil for 5 minutes while stirring constantly. Remove from the heat, and stir in the baking soda and vanilla. The mixture will be light and foamy. Immediately pour over the popcorn in the pans, and stir to coat. Don't worry too much at this point about getting all of the corn coated. Bake for 1 hour, removing the pans, and giving them each a good stir every 15 minutes. Line the counter top with waxed paper. Dump the corn out onto the waxed paper and separate the pieces. Allow to cool completely, then store in airtight containers or resalable bags.
