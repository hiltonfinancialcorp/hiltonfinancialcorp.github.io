# CHAPTER TEMPLATE {-}

Here's another chapter file.

You can split each chapter into files, or use one big file. Whatever you'd like!

When you add a chapter, go to the `_bookdown.yml` file and add it to the list of files to be included in the book, in the order you'd like them.

E.g.

`rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "01-chapter.Rmd, "02-chapter.Rmd"]`

This lets you rearrange the book easily, by rearranging the order of items in the list:

`rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "02-chapter.Rmd, "01-chapter.Rmd"]`

The file names don't really matter, 
since you're specifying the order of files manually, 
but most folks use the `xx-name` style.

It might also make sense to not use numbers, and instead titles.

`rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "my-start.Rmd, "history-banking.Rmd"]`

##  SUBSECTION TITLE

The more `###` you add, the farther down you go into subsections. 
See how this one got a number, because we didn't add the `{-}`?

## Addng pictures {-}

The following code will insert a picture.



```{r example-coins, fig.cap='Durable!', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('images/coins.jpg'))
```



### SUBSUBSECTION TITLE {-}

Such nesting!

Look, a [clickable link](#picturetemplate) to somewhere else in the book!
