# CHAPTER TEMPLATE {-}

Here's another chapter file.

You can split each chapter into files, or use one big file. Whatever you'd like!

When you add a chapter, go to the `_bookdown.yml` file and add it to the list of files to be included in the book, in the order you'd like them.

E.g.

`rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "01-chapter.Rmd, "02-chapter.Rmd"]`

This lets you rearrange the book easily, by rearranging the order of items in the list:

`rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "02-chapter.Rmd, "01-chapter.Rmd"]`

The file names don't really matter, 
since you're specifying the order of files manually, 
but most folks use the `xx-name` style.

It might also make sense to not use numbers, and instead titles.

`rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "my-start.Rmd, "history-banking.Rmd"]`

##  SUBSECTION TITLE

The more `###` you add, the farther down you go into subsections. 
See how this one got a number, because we didn't add the `{-}`?

## Addng pictures {-}

The following code will insert a picture.



```{r example-macarons, fig.cap='A pretty picture of tasty food', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('images/macarons.jpg'))
```

The phrase after the first `r` must be hypenated if it's more than one word (spaces will confuse it), 
it's a reference you can use later if you want to point the reader to this specific image.

`fig.cap` allows you to add a caption.

`echo = FALSE` makes it so the code that inserts the picture does not show up in the final product (switch it to `TRUE` or leave it out to see what happens).

the `knitr`... section contains a path to the image. 
It's probably easiest to upload all the images in the `images` folder, 
and give them all short and easy names.

(If you're looking at the source code, notice that we added `#picturetemplate` after the `{-` part of the section title. 
This allows us to reference this section elsewhere in the book, with a clickable link, if wanted.
If we end up changing the order of things, it will automatically detect that and correct the link and numbering for it,
so it's better than using a page number or something like that.)

### SUBSUBSECTION TITLE {-}

Such nesting!

Look, a [clickable link](#phototemplate) to somewhere else in the book!
